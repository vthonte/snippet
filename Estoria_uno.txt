She had been gazing at the hustling tides, coming in an organized and synchronous manner. But her mind wasn't there. Not at the persistent tides approaching the shore, not at the yellowish blue sky meeting the ocean at the horizon with the reddish white sunset.

She was still. The rhythmic sound of the tides, the soothing sounds of sea birds had no effect on his mind.  She ignored everything. She was thinking about something. Warm and wet tears rolled down her cheek. Her liberate locks of hair tried to mimic the waves, swaying in the breeze. Her blue eyes kept staring in the same direction, sparkling due to the combined effect of the tears and the beautiful sunlight. Her face had a feeling of satisfaction however.
